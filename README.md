# Mobile Price Classification using Support Vector Machine (Polynomial Kernel)

> Team member: Arif Farhan Bukhori & Muhammad Rafli Aulia
## Overview
This is a final project for the course _Accelerated Machine Learning Program_ from Zenius. In this project, a Support Vector Machine (using Polynomial Kernel) is built to classify Mobile Prices. We found out that the model reached an accuracy of about 95.75%. While the base line logistic regression model had a much lower accuracy of 64.50%.

## Dataset
The dataset used are from kaggle, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification) to access the dataset.

## Library Used
- gensim - *enables storing and querying word vectors*
- keras - *a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow*
- matplotlib - *a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures*
- numpy - *the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python*
- pandas - *provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python*
- sklearn - *a software machine learning library*
- tensorflow - *an open source machine learning framework for everyone*
